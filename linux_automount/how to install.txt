how to install usb automount script

tl;dr - 
0 make sure there are three folders - /mnt/usbdisk3, /mnt/usbdisk4, /mnt/usbdisk5 - with proper permissions.
1 add the udev rule file
2 add the mount script
3 make mount script executable 
4 restart udev
5 test


step by step - 
(as root)

cp 68-custom-usb-automount.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/68-custom-usb-automount.rules
cp usb_num.sh /usr/local/bin/usb_num.sh
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/usb_num.sh		#( a+x makes the file executable by any user. chmod 777 also works. )
/sbin/start_udev


That's it.
To test connect HDD, wait for the disk to be avaliable and run "df -l".
